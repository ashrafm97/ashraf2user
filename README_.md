#PYODBC and OOP

we are looking at the pyodbc package
1)
we are going to make an oop module that abstracts our interaction with the NORTHWIND database
2)
And then further abstracts the interaction with specific tables
3)
Finally, where appropriate we will use the CRUD design to build methods. 

## CRUD
* CREATE 
* READ
* READ ONE 
* READ ALL on parameters
* DELETE or DESTROY
